Here one chooses a model for the plant, whose parameters are unknown, and the plant parameters are recursively estimated; controller gains are computed assuming that the present estimate is corrent.

Then this framework will be used for theoretical generalizations of the model and their estimation using regression software. By the end of the course, students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate the assumptions of the standard linear regression model. This includes methods for dealing with heteroskedastic data, observations that may be dependent over time, response distributions with heavy tails or limited range (such as binary outcomes and count variables), and observations that may suffer from selection bias.",

Different types of states have addressed ethnic problems in different ways: some have sought to maintain harmonious multicultural communities: others have preferred to assimilate or segregate minorities; yet others have engaged in ethnic cleansing.

Though the bulk of the material deals with Europe in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries, the course is methodological in nature and is intended for all graduate students of social history.  Students in HIST 622 read the great microhistories including Davis' The Return of Martin Guerre, LeRoy Ladurie's Montaillou and Caranaval at Romans, Spence's The Death of Woman Wang, Ginzburg's Night Battles, and others.  Through these sources students acquire a deep understanding of the historiography surrounding this genre.

Attend and complete a scientific writing workshop (90 min class time) that will provide background on literature searching, citation and proper management of references as part of preparation of the Thesis Proposal, and participate in a one-on-one appointment with the Pharmacy liaison librarian to discuss research strategies and reinforce academic integrity.  The workshop and appointments will be offered each term by the Pharmacy liaison librarian.\n\nb.  Attend two Thesis Proposal defences by other students, prior to the students own oral defence.  \n\nThis course is only available for the first Thesis Proposal taken within the Pharmacy Program.  If a student is required to fulfill a second Thesis Proposal (for example, if being reassessed for transfer to the PhD) no additional course credit is available. \n\nThe Thesis Proposal component involves the preparation of a written research proposal and oral defence of the proposal.  The intent is to learn how to use the literature to stimulate in-depth thinking about the basis of their thesis research project and to encourage development of their scientific oral presentation skills.  The thesis proposal should outline the reasons for undertaking the project, concisely survey the relevant literature, present a detailed description of the methodology to be used and outline any preliminary results acquired at the time of the proposal.  The written proposal will be considered by an examination committee that will normally comprise the students Advisory Committee plus an independent Chair who will assume that role for all thesis proposals within one academic term.  The full Examination Committee will independently grade the written proposal, and separately assign a grade to the oral defence. The simple average of those scores (two per committee member) will be the students grade for the course.",

And how are children able to recognize what others pretend?  Are children behaviourists about pretend play? Or does successful pretence signal that your children engage in mental state reasoning ('theory of mind')?  Theories of children's (and adults') pretence have sought to provide answers to the questions.  These theories are still actively debated, and are the main topic of this course.

Where these images are acquired from a microscope, telescope, satellite, or medical imaging device there is a statistical image processing task:  the interference of something - an artery, a road, a DNA marker, an oil spill - from imagery, possibly noisy, blurry, or incomplete.  The goal of this course is to address methods for solving multidimensional statistical problems, emphasizing theory, mathematical modeling, and algorithms.  Specific topics of interest include inverse problems, multidimensional modeling, random fields, and hierarchical methods.",

Video streams are analyzed as dynamic systems, linear and non-linear.  If the system can be approximated as linear and Gaussian in terms of the dynamic noise in the process and measurement, then Kalman filter techniques are used.  This refers to sequential state estimation.  For nonlinear dynamical systems, the EFK (Extended Kalman filter) can be used by a liberalization of the stat space model.  Particle filters are used to address state estimation problems where the systems are non-linear and non-Gaussian.  Particle Filters are rooted in Bayesian estimation and Monte Carlo procedures.  The course builds upon these techniques in studying visual tracking and the components of Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) procedures.",

Fuzzy logic and neural networks share the common ability to improve the decision making process for systems characterized by ill-defined dynamics and working in an imprecise environment. For fuzzy systems this is done through linguistic description of the system by combining fuzzy sets with fuzzy rules following a well-structured numerical estimation procedure. For neural networks, this is done through detecting patterns and relationships from a set of training input-output data gathered from the system, while learning from relationships and adapting to change. The course is mainly intended as introductory material for fuzzy logic and neural networks and outlines the most recent developments in these areas and their applications for intelligent systems design.

For roughly three centuries, until the suicide of the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, the Egyptians lived under an alien ruling authority of Hellenic heritage.  Furthermore, they lived and worked alongside numerous immigrants of the same heritage, immigrants who appear to have benefited frequently from the differential laws, practices, and institutions that favoured them and did nothing for the native people of Egypt.  Yet at the same time, a study of Ptolemaic Egypt reveals also a pattern of increasing assimilation between Greeks and Egyptians. Such assimilation was not solely the result of increasing mutual tolerance and respect.  Indeed, the history of Greco-Macedonian relations with the Egyptians demonstrates that whatever respect and privileges the ruling classes ultimately granted to the natives of Egypt were at least in part the result of violent Egyptian assertiveness, in the form of armed rebellion.  The history of interactions between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic Egypt offers an unmatched opportunity for the examination of the relations between rulers and ruled, of the clash between ethnic groups, and of the forces that lead to reception on the one hand and resistance on the other.",

Sustainability thinking, policies, and programs aim to increase and maintain human well-being by integrating or reconciling current social and economic goals (e.g., economic growth; poverty alleviation; gender inequality) with long-term environmental objectives (e.g., improved environmental quality; climate stability; biodiversity conservation; and managing resources to ensure future access). Case studies are used to illustrate solutions for realizing sustainability, emphasizing efforts underway for reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The course assesses four intersecting and sometimes competing approaches for realizing sustainability: technological innovation; market-based approaches; state regulation and investment; and individual and collective ('grassroots') action. Key values underlying sustainability are explored, including notions of the \"good life\", democracy, social justice, and efficiency.",

The workshop and appointments will be offered each term by the Pharmacy liaison librarian.\n\nb.  Attend two Thesis Proposal defences by other students, prior to the students own oral defence.  \n\nThis course is only available for the first Thesis Proposal taken within the Pharmacy Program.  If a student is required to fulfill a second Thesis Proposal (for example, if being assessed for internal transfer from the MSc to PhD program) no additional course credit is available. \n\nThe Thesis Proposal component involves the preparation of a written research proposal and oral defence of the proposal.  The intent is to learn how to use the literature to stimulate in-depth thinking about the basis of their thesis research project and to encourage development of their scientific oral presentation skills.  The thesis proposal should outline the reasons for undertaking the project, concisely survey the relevant literature, present a detailed description of the methodology to be used and outline any preliminary results acquired at the time of the proposal.  The written proposal will be considered by an examination committee that will normally comprise the students Advisory Committee plus an independent Chair who will assume that role for all thesis proposals within one academic term.  The full Examination Committee will independently grade the written proposal, and separately assign a grade to the oral defence.

Students will learn about emergent literacy via a once-weekly seminar component and a once-weekly unpaid practicum placement at a local elementary public school where students will have the opportunity to read one-on-one with children who are at the beginning stages of reading. The practicum component will involve a commitment of up to 30 hours during the formal lecture period. Students wishing to enter the course must obtain a police check prior to the second week of classes. Transportation to the apprenticeship/volunteer setting is the student's responsibility. Please review the course application form for information on safety for students on unpaid work placement and insurance responsibilities.
